# NFL Photo Sharing App ðŸ“¸

A modern Android application that allows NFL fans to share their game-day memories and experiences through photos. Built with Clean Architecture and Modern Android Development practices.

## Architecture Overview

### Clean Architecture

This project implements Clean Architecture to ensure:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between data, domain, and presentation layers
- **Testability**: Easy to test each component in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
- **Scalability**: New features can be added without modifying existing code

### Modular Architecture

The app is structured into the following modules:

```plaintext
